    - prompt: >-
        A switch is powered on for the first time and receives an Ethernet
        frame from a host. What will the switch do with the frame with an empty
        CAM table?
      type: "multiple choice"
      correct_choice: 1
      choices:
        - id: 1
          text: "The switch will flood the frame out of all up/up interfaces."
        - id: 2
          text: >-
            The switch will flood the frame out of all up/up interfaces that
            are in a Spanning Tree Protocol Forwarding state.
        - id: 3
          text: "The switch will drop the frame."
        - id: 4
          text: >-
            The switch will forward the frame directly to the destination host.
      explanation: >-
        This behavior is often called "Unknown Unicast Flooding". If a switch
        receives an Ethernet frame destined to a MAC address that is not
        present in the switch's MAC address table, the switch will flood that
        frame out of all up/up interfaces that are in a Spanning Tree Protocol
        Forwarding state in the relevant VLAN.

        A network operator configured an SVI (Switch Virtual Interface) for
        management purposes on a switch. However, they cannot ICMP ping the IP
        address of the SVI. What command did they forget to use on the SVI?

          text: "no switchport"
      explanation: >-
        The "no shutdown" interface configuration command brings an interface
        administratively up. This allows the interface to transition to an
        up/up status. Once the interface is in an up/up status, it can respond
        to ICMP Echo Request packets destined to the IP address assigned to the
        interface.

        can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and
        even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia.

      explanation: >-
        Spine-leaf architecture is typically deployed as two layers: spines
        (such as an aggregation layer), and leaves (such as an access layer).
        Spine-leaf topologies provide high-bandwidth, low-latency, nonblocking
        server-to-server connectivity. Leaf (aggregation) switches are what
        provide devices access to the fabric (the network of spine and leaf
        switches) and are typically deployed at the top of the rack. Generally,
        devices connect to the leaf switches. Devices can include servers,
        Layer 4-7 services (firewalls and load balancers), and WAN or Internet
        routers. Leaf switches do not connect to other leaf switches. In
        spine-and-leaf architecture, every leaf should connect to every spine
        in a full mesh. Spine (aggregation) switches are used to connect to all
        leaf switches and are typically deployed at the end or middle of the
        row. Spine switches do not connect to other spine switches.

        There are two hints to discover the original subnet set that this was
        created from. First, it is explicitly said it is a class B, which is of size
        /16. Second, no explicit original network is provided. The only safe
        conclusion that can be made is that the original network is a /16. Since you
        have two bits to work with, the difference between the original and given
        networks, 4 subnets are available to use.

        The network mask is 255.255.248.0, which means there are 11 bits used for
        the host portion, 3 of which are in the third octet. You can safely ignore
        the fourth octet for this exercise as all bits will be on in that octet for
        broadcast. The third octet uses three bits, which means we work in multiples
        of 8 for this as three bits provide 8 permutations. Quick math tells us that
        96 is the closest multiple of 8 that is not larger than 100. The next value
        is 104, or 172.19.104.0. Subtract 1 to get 172.19.103.255.

        The CIDR notion indicates a mask using 30 network bits and 2 host bits. The

        meaning it is the network ID or first IP in the subnet. Add 3 (.4 is 1, so

      explanation: >-
        The CIDR notion indicates a mask using 20 network bits and 12 host bits. The
        20th bit is part of the third octet, making that the interesting octet to
        work with and meaning we can take a shortcut by ignoring the other octets.
        The 20th bit means there are 4 bits for host bits within the third octet, 4
        bits provides 16 permutations so we work in multiples of 16 and some quick
        math shows that 224 is the largest multiple of 16 without going over 225.
        The question asks for the network ID so all host bits are set to 0, which
        gives us 224.0 for the last two octets, or 65.167.224.0 for our network ID.

        The question asks for a network of at least size 23 without being wasteful.
        Translate that to there should be some value of host bits that equal at
        least 23 with waste of 23 or less. Using 4 bits is only 16 permutations so
        that is too small. Using 5 host bits provides 32 permutations, wasting 9
        IPs. The next size up would be more wasteful, so use the mask that uses 5
        bits or 255.255.255.224.

        Of the available answers, ARP Probe is the best answer. While it is ARP, it
        is more specifically an extra ARP to determine whether a client is using
        that IP as relying on ARP only could lead to stale IPs remaining in the
        consumed pool due to needing to wait for the ARP table to age out. A
        Gratuitous ARP would be for if the interface changes IP and wants to inform
        other devices that it has a new IP.

        This is a subnetting exercise, with the goal to find the smallest sized
        network that both 10.0.2.45 and 10.0.9.254 fit within. Since the third octet
        is the first octet where things change, we can safely ignore any answer that
        uses the fourth octet as the interesting octet. Of the two remaining
        answers, 255.255.240.0 is a block size of 16 which when applied to the PC IP
        we start at 10.0.0.0 and run through 10.0.15.255. This allows the PC and
        gateway IPs to be within the same subnet without being wasteful since

        Guard, but that will only trigger if it sends a superior BPDU. BPDU Guard
        will outright block the port should a BPDU be received. PVST+ and MST are
        flavors of STP and will not prevent a switch from being connected.

        The correct syntax for a static route is `ip route [destination network]
        [destination mask] [next-hop]` so of the options, `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
        192.168.0.1` is the only correct one.

        When using a link local address as the next hop in IPv6, the route must be
        fully specified. This means the egress or outbound interface must also be
        specified. This is because a single link local address can be used in
        multiple places on the same network legally.

        The question specifically calls out that communicaitng with IP addresses
        fails, browsing the web fails, and that they cannot communicate with remote

      explanation: >-
        Fa0/2 will need the IP helper configured. DHCP and DHCP relay work
        similarly, in that the interface listening for DHCP Discover messages must
        be able to receive those messages from client devices. Since DHCP Discover
        messages are broadcast, the interface the IP helper is configured on must be
        on the same broadcast domain as client devices. Knowing nothing about the
        network beyond that clients should be on the same side of the router as
        Fa0/2, we can pick Fa0/2 as the only reasonable answer.

        Ideally, latency and jitter should be low. Across the Internet or other very
        large networks a latency of 150ms and 30ms jitter should not be exceeded.
        Latency measures the time it takes for a packet to get from point A to B,
        while jitter measures the difference in latency between packets. A low
        jitter means that packets are arriving at regular latencies, which means
        conversation will sound more smooth and less choppy. Low latency allows a
        conversation to occur with little delay, which can be noticed when people on
        the phone talk over one another by mistake.

        Things like DSCP marking can affect this. Queuing is the act of placing a
        packet in the buffer to be scheduled, or transmitted. QoS is too general of
        a term, though it isn't necessarily wrong there are parts of QoS that are
        about ingress into the queue or dropping packets.

        True to its name, the first packet to arrive will be the first packet to

        intelligently, using values and multiple queues to help move packets along
        so the first packet received may not always egress first. CQ (Custom
        Queuing) uses multiple queues with variable queue limits and traffic
        classification to determine which packets are sent out. WRR (Weighted Round

        for configuration as opposed to manually configuration. Get would return the
        value of a MIB, Inform messages are sent in response to Trap messages, and
        Response would be a message used to reply to a request from a manager such
        as a Get request.

      explanation: >-
        The DSCP value used for the actual voice stream in calls is 46. This traffic
        is usually RTP, which is different from SIP. SIP is usually DSCP 24, since
        it is not as essential to receive every SIP packet in a timely fashion as
        they only control signalling information such as call setup.

        The ip summary-address command does reset neighborships, but only on
        the interface under which it is configured. After those neighborships
        come up, R1 will advertise the summary route, but none of the
        subordinate routes inside that summary. The summary route will use a
        metric equal to the metric of the lowest metric subordinate route,
        approximately 1,000,000 in this case.

        Router R1 connects to Router R2 over an Ethernet LAN with both routers
        using their Fa0/0 interfaces. R1 learns a route from R2 using EIGRP for
        IPv6. That route lists Fa0/0 as the outgoing interface with R2 as the
        next hop. The configuration excerpt shows all relevant configuration
        on R2's Fa0/0 interface. Which of the following is true about R1's

        EIGRP uses the link-local address as the next hop for routing
        protocols. Based on R2's MAC address, R2's link-local address on Fa0/0
        will be FE80::1311:11FF:FE11:1111. This value is derived by splitting
        the MAC, inserting FFFE, and flipping bit 7, making the initial hex 11
        become hex 13.

        OSPF creates a Type 2 LSA for a subnet when the router interface
        connected to the subnet calls for the election of a designated router
        (DR) and at least two routers have discovered each other and elected a
        DR. Then, the DR creates and floods the Type 2 LSA. IOS by default does
        not elect a DR on point-to-point topologies. It does on router LAN
        interfaces. One answer states that one router only exists in the
        subnet, so it does not actually find a second router and elect a DR.
        In the other case, a DR and BDR have been elected, but the router
        described in the answer is the BDR, not the DR. So, none of the other
