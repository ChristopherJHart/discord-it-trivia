        A switch is powered on for the first time and receives an Ethernet
        frame from a host. What will the switch do with the frame with an empty
        CAM table?

        - id: 1
          text: "The switch will flood the frame out of all up/up interfaces."
        - id: 2
          text: >-
            The switch will flood the frame out of all up/up interfaces that
            are in a Spanning Tree Protocol Forwarding state.

          text: "The switch will drop the frame."
        - id: 4
          text: >-
            The switch will forward the frame directly to the destination host.
      explanation: >-
        This behavior is often called "Unknown Unicast Flooding". If a switch
        receives an Ethernet frame destined to a MAC address that is not
        present in the switch's MAC address table, the switch will flood that
        frame out of all up/up interfaces that are in a Spanning Tree Protocol
        Forwarding state in the relevant VLAN.
    - prompt: >-
        A network operator configured an SVI (Switch Virtual Interface) for
        management purposes on a switch. However, they cannot ICMP ping the IP
        address of the SVI. What command did they forget to use on the SVI?

      explanation: >-
        The "no shutdown" interface configuration command brings an interface
        administratively up. This allows the interface to transition to an
        up/up status. Once the interface is in an up/up status, it can respond
        to ICMP Echo Request packets destined to the IP address assigned to the
        interface.

        can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and
        even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia.

      explanation: >-
        Spine-leaf architecture is typically deployed as two layers: spines
        (such as an aggregation layer), and leaves (such as an access layer).
        Spine-leaf topologies provide high-bandwidth, low-latency, nonblocking
        server-to-server connectivity. Leaf (aggregation) switches are what
        provide devices access to the fabric (the network of spine and leaf
        switches) and are typically deployed at the top of the rack. Generally,
        devices connect to the leaf switches. Devices can include servers,
        Layer 4-7 services (firewalls and load balancers), and WAN or Internet
        routers. Leaf switches do not connect to other leaf switches. In
        spine-and-leaf architecture, every leaf should connect to every spine
        in a full mesh. Spine (aggregation) switches are used to connect to all
        leaf switches and are typically deployed at the end or middle of the
        row. Spine switches do not connect to other spine switches.

        addresses (FEC0::/10) are equivalent to private IP addresses in IPv4
        but now they are deprecated. Link-local addresses only used for
        communications within the local subnet. It is usually created
